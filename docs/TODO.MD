# TODO: Ticketing Settlement System Implementation Plan

This file outlines the steps and tasks required to build a fully-featured ticketing settlement system following Clean Architecture and a Microservices approach, orchestrated using .NET Aspire. The system includes a Blazor + Radzen frontend, SQL Server databases, Azure Service Bus for messaging, and Azure AD for authentication/authorization. The solution is designed for deployment on Azure.

## 1. Project Setup and Structure

- [ ] **Solution Setup**
  - [ ] Create `TicketingSettlementSystem.sln` solution.
  - [ ] Create projects for each microservice:
    - **TicketingService**
      - `Ticketing.Domain` (Domain layer)
      - `Ticketing.Application` (Application layer)
      - `Ticketing.Infrastructure` (Infrastructure layer)
      - `Ticketing.API` (Presentation layer – Web API)
    - **SettlementService**
      - `Settlement.Domain`
      - `Settlement.Application`
      - `Settlement.Infrastructure`
      - `Settlement.API`
  - [ ] Create the Frontend project:
    - `TicketingSettlement.BlazorApp` (Blazor application using Radzen)
  - [ ] Create common/shared libraries:
    - `BuildingBlocks/TicketingSettlement.Contracts` (Shared DTOs & Integration Events)
    - `BuildingBlocks/TicketingSettlement.ServiceDefaults` (Cross-cutting services/configurations)
  - [ ] Add .NET Aspire orchestration:
    - Create `TicketingSettlement.AppHost` project.
    - Configure AppHost to include the API projects for Ticketing and Settlement.

---

## 2. Ticketing Service Implementation

- [ ] **Domain Layer (Ticketing.Domain)**
  - [ ] Define core entities (e.g., `Ticket`, `SaleTransaction`).
  - [ ] Create domain events (e.g., `TicketSoldEvent`).

- [ ] **Application Layer (Ticketing.Application)**
  - [ ] Implement use cases (e.g., `SellTicketCommand`, `RefundTicketCommand`).
  - [ ] Define repository interfaces (e.g., `ITicketRepository`).
  - [ ] Define messaging interface (`IMessagePublisher`) for event publication.

- [ ] **Infrastructure Layer (Ticketing.Infrastructure)**
  - [ ] Set up EF Core DbContext (`TicketingDbContext`) with `DbSet<Ticket>` and `DbSet<SaleTransaction>`.
  - [ ] Implement repository classes (e.g., `TicketRepository`).
  - [ ] Implement Azure Service Bus publisher (`AzureServiceBusMessagePublisher`).

- [ ] **API Layer (Ticketing.API)**
  - [ ] Create API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/tickets/sell`, `GET /api/tickets/{id}`).
  - [ ] Secure endpoints using Azure AD (JWT Bearer authentication).

---

## 3. Settlement Service Implementation

- [ ] **Domain Layer (Settlement.Domain)**
  - [ ] Define core entities (e.g., `Payment`, `SettlementRecord`).

- [ ] **Application Layer (Settlement.Application)**
  - [ ] Implement use cases (e.g., `ProcessPaymentCommand`, `ConfirmPaymentCommand`).
  - [ ] Define repository interfaces (e.g., `IPaymentRepository`).
  - [ ] Define interfaces for external integrations (e.g., `IBankGateway`).

- [ ] **Infrastructure Layer (Settlement.Infrastructure)**
  - [ ] Set up EF Core DbContext (`SettlementDbContext`).
  - [ ] Implement repository classes (e.g., `PaymentRepository`).
  - [ ] Implement a Service Bus subscriber (using a BackgroundService) to handle `TicketSoldEvent`.
  - [ ] Integrate with a banking/payment API via `IBankGateway`.

- [ ] **API Layer (Settlement.API)**
  - [ ] Create API endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/payments/{id}`, `POST /api/payments/confirm`).
  - [ ] Secure endpoints using Azure AD.

---

## 4. Frontend (Blazor + Radzen) Implementation

- [ ] **Project Setup**
  - [ ] Set up project structure (Pages, Shared components, etc.).
  - [ ] Install and configure Radzen.Blazor NuGet package.
  
- [ ] **Authentication Integration**
  - [ ] Configure Azure AD authentication (using MSAL or Microsoft.Identity.Web).

- [ ] **UI Development**
  - [ ] Implement pages for:
    - Ticket selling (with a form to call `POST /api/tickets/sell`).
    - Viewing ticket/payment status.
    - Administration/Reporting (if needed).
  - [ ] Configure HttpClient to call Ticketing and Settlement APIs.

---

## 5. Azure Service Bus Integration

- [ ] **Azure Setup**
  - [ ] Create an Azure Service Bus Namespace.
  - [ ] Define Topics/Queues (e.g., topic `ticketing-events` with a subscription for Settlement Service).

- [ ] **Ticketing Service**
  - [ ] Implement event publishing for ticket sales (publish `TicketSoldEvent`).

- [ ] **Settlement Service**
  - [ ] Implement event consumption using a BackgroundService or library like MassTransit.
  - [ ] Process incoming `TicketSoldEvent` messages.

---

## 6. Database Integration (SQL Server)

- [ ] **Database Design**
  - [ ] Create separate SQL Server databases (or schemas) for Ticketing and Settlement services.
  
- [ ] **EF Core Migrations**
  - [ ] Create and apply initial migrations for each service.
  - [ ] Configure connection strings (store in configuration files and inject via .NET Aspire).

---

## 7. Authentication and Authorization (Azure AD)

- [ ] **Azure AD Registration**
  - [ ] Register the Blazor frontend as an Azure AD application.
  - [ ] Register the Ticketing and Settlement APIs (with appropriate scopes/roles).

- [ ] **Configuration**
  - [ ] Update appsettings.json in the Blazor and API projects with Azure AD settings.
  - [ ] Configure authentication middleware in the Blazor app and API projects.

---

## 8. .NET Aspire Orchestration Setup

- [ ] **AppHost Configuration**
  - [ ] Add microservice projects to the .NET Aspire AppHost configuration.
  - [ ] Configure ServiceDefaults (logging, health checks, DB connections, etc.).
  
- [ ] **Local Testing**
  - [ ] Validate service discovery and orchestration using the Aspire dashboard.

---

## 9. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

- [ ] **Build and Test**
  - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflows to build, test, and package each project.
  - [ ] Run unit and integration tests.

- [ ] **Dockerization**
  - [ ] Write Dockerfiles for each microservice API and the Blazor app.
  - [ ] Build and push images to Azure Container Registry (ACR).

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions to deploy containers to AKS (or Azure App Service/Container Apps).
  - [ ] Automate database migration execution if needed.

---

## 10. Azure Deployment

- [ ] **Containerization and Images**
  - [ ] Finalize Dockerfiles and test container builds locally.

- [ ] **Infrastructure Provisioning**
  - [ ] Provision Azure resources:
    - AKS cluster (or choose App Service/Container Apps)
    - Azure SQL Databases
    - Azure Service Bus
    - Azure Key Vault for secrets

- [ ] **Kubernetes/Helm Setup**
  - [ ] Create Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for each service.
  - [ ] Configure Ingress for routing (e.g., frontend at `frontend.yourdomain.com`, APIs at `api.yourdomain.com`).

- [ ] **Deployment Verification**
  - [ ] Deploy the solution using CI/CD.
  - [ ] Validate endpoint accessibility, service logs, and health checks.

---

## 11. Monitoring, Logging, and Scalability

- [ ] **Logging and Telemetry**
  - [ ] Integrate structured logging (e.g., Serilog) in all services.
  - [ ] Set up Application Insights for distributed tracing.

- [ ] **Health Checks**
  - [ ] Implement health check endpoints in the APIs.

- [ ] **Autoscaling**
  - [ ] Configure autoscaling (e.g., Horizontal Pod Autoscaler in AKS or scaling settings in App Service).

---

## 12. Documentation and Testing

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Write integration tests for end-to-end workflows.
  - [ ] Create test cases for domain and application logic.

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update README.md with architecture, setup, and deployment instructions.
  - [ ] Maintain a changelog and usage documentation in the repository wiki.

## 13. Future Improvements (Optional)

- [ ] Evaluate implementation of the Outbox pattern for event publishing.
- [ ] Consider adding additional microservices (e.g., Reporting, Notifications).
- [ ] Investigate using MassTransit for advanced messaging scenarios.
- [ ] Explore Azure Container Apps as an alternative hosting platform.
